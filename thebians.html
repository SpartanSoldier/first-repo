<P>Hello and welcome to Infocast.<br/><br/>This is a small website contaning information about the world of ancient Greece.</p>

        <p>Once the most powerful city in Ancient Greece, Thebes has long been overshadowed by Athens and Sparta.</p>
Myth and legend surround the once powerful and influential ancient city of Thebes; birthplace of ancient Greek hero Hercules.</p>
It is said that Thebes was founded when the ground was sown with dragonâ€™s teeth, and the city was razed to the ground by Alexander the Great.</p>
And yet the rich history of Thebes has been largely forgotten in favour of its rivals Athens and Sparta.</p>
Here, Paul Cartledge, historian and author of Thebes, shares just a few fascinating facts about the ancient city.</p>
From the founding of Thebes and origins of the Oedipus myth, to the stories of Crates of Thebes and Pindar the poet, this is history that should be remembered.</p>
