        <h2 class="HeaderText2SS">The Syracusians</h2>
The city of Syracuse is located on the east coast of Sicily and was originally a Greek colony founded by Corinth in 734 BCE.<br/>
The city enjoyed a period of expansion and prosperity under the tyrant Gelon in the 5th century BCE, survived a two-year siege by Athenian forces from 415 to 413 BCE, and again prospered under the tyrant Dionysius in the 4th century BCE when the city controlled much of Sicily and large portions of southern Italy.<br/>

<h3 class= "HeaderText2SC">From Colony to Democracy</h3>

The colony was in fact first established on the small island of Ortygia, chosen for its natural harbours and spring water, but the community of early Greek settlers quickly spread to the main island, both settlements being linked by a man-made causeway.<br/>
 The aristocratic-led government achieved a period of prosperity which is evidenced in the Archaic period by the city founding its own colonies of Helorus, Acrae, Camarina, and Casmanae.<br/>
  Also dating to this period are remains of 6th century BCE temples dedicated to Zeus, Apollo, and Athena.<br/>
